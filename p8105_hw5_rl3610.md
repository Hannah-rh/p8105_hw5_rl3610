# Problem 1

### Create a funtion

``` r
bday_sim = function(n) {
  
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)

  has_duplicate = length(unique(birthdays)) < n

  has_duplicate
  
}
```

### Simulation

``` r
bday_sim_results_df = 
  expand_grid(
    group_size = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    has_duplicate = map_lgl(group_size, bday_sim)
  )

bday_summary_df = 
  bday_sim_results_df |> 
  group_by(group_size) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_shared_bday = mean(has_duplicate)
  )
```

### Make the plot

``` r
bday_summary_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = group_size, y = prob_shared_bday)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Shared Birthday by Group Size",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday",
    caption = "Based on 10,000 simulations per group size"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The simulation results demonstrate the well-known “Birthday Paradox”
phenomenon: With just 23 people, the probability of a shared birthday
exceeds 50%, and with 50 people, the probability approaches over 97%.
